# Additional information
## How I did it
* Manual focus, often completely out of focus
* Low F-number to catch as much light as possible
* Post-Processing in Darktable. 
The editing files are in this repo too, so you can tweak it yourself if you dislike something. 
But basically, the three main editing things I did were:
    * Added grain
    * Increased or decreased the vibrance
    * Decreased contrast
## Copyright
You can use, share and tweak it how you want, but are not allowed to make money with it. 
Credit my work whenever you can please. :)
