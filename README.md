# Background  
The photos are all made based on a light shattering plastic foil, that was glued on my balcony window.
Depending on the time of the day, it created lovely light spectacles. Under normal daylight, it looks like this:

But under the correct conditions, it may look like this: ![grafik](https://github.com/gluckgluckwasserbauch/wallpaper-the-window-of-dreams/assets/99470494/a435fd8f-5789-4a47-9836-474ee94274a8)


# Additional information
## How I did it
* Manual focus, often completely out of focus
* Low F-number to catch as much light as possible
* Post-Processing in Darktable. 
The editing files are in this repo too, so you can tweak it yourself if you dislike something. 
But basically, the three main editing things I did were:
    * Added grain
    * Increased or decreased the vibrance
    * Decreased contrast
