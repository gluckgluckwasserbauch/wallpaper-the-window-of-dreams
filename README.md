# Additional information
## How I did it
* Manual focus, often completely out of focus
* Low F-number
* Post-Processing in Darktable (the editing files are in this repo too, so you can tweak it yourself)
## Copyright
You can use, share and tweak it how you want, but are not allowed to make money out of my work. Credit my work if you can :)
